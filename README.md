## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - [Actors and stakeholder table](./ActorsTable.md)
  - One [use-case diagram](./uc-diagram.md)
  - One detailed written [use case](./use-case.md)
1. Four diagrams: [Sequence](), [Class](), [Activity](), [Component]()|[Deployment]()
  - Each diagram should be accompanied by a section discussing the design and especially the **unique** design considerations embodied in the diagram.
1. [OCL]: One diagram with constrains (see CAR example in lecture slides)

**The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.**

- Format: Each part has a separte markdown page including links to XMI files and image files

- **Submission dates**: 3 parts, each successive weeks, by pull request
